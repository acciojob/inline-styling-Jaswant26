	<p>Flowers are the reproductive part of a plant. They produce seeds, which eventually become other flowers. Flowers are made up of a floral axis, which contains the essential reproductive organs, and accessory organs, such as sepals and petals. The accessory organs protect the essential organs and attract pollinating insects.
